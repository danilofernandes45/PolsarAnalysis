Abstract = {{We consider a problem originating in radar polarimetry for which the
   radar target is to be characterized by the properties of its coherent
   polarization state, given complete coherent backscattering matrix data
   sets at one frequency and for one target aspect angle.  First, the Jones
   vector formalism for the coherent monostatic case and Sinclair's
   backscattering matrix {[}S(AB)] for the general polarization basis (AB)
   are introduced.  Using the unitary change of polarization state
   transformation, we present the concept of the characteristic
   polarization states of a scatterer, which was introduced by Kennaugh and
   Huynen.  The generalized unitary transformation matrix formulation under
   the change-of-basis transformation, expressed in terms of the
   generalized polarization ratio rho(AB), is developed for emphasizing the
   unique properties of the interrelation among the existing characteristic
   polarization states.  For the monostatic reciprocal case (S(AB) = S(BA))
   treated here, it is shown that there exist in total five pairs of
   characteristic polarization states:  the orthogonal cross-polarization
   null and the copolarization maximum-state pairs, which are identical and
   share one main circle with the copolarization null and the orthogonal
   cross-polarization maximum-state pairs, the latter being at right angles
   to the cross-polarization null pairs; and a newly identified pair, the
   orthogonal cross-polarization saddle-point extrema that are normal to
   the plane (main circle) spanned by the other four pairs.  With this
   complete and unique mathematical description of Huynen's polarization
   fork concept, it is possible to study the problem of polarimetric radar
   target optimization more rigorously.  Various examples are provided and
   interpreted by comparing the unique result with the results of previous
   incomplete analyses.  In conclusion, the relevance of these canonical
   results to optical polarimetry are highlighted and interpreted.}},
