Title = {{Scattering Characteristics of X-, C- and L-Band PolSAR Data Examined for
   the Tundra Environment of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Canada}},

Abstract = {{In this study, polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data at
   X-, C- and L-Bands, acquired by the satellites: TerraSAR-X (2011),
   Radarsat-2 (2011), ALOS (2010) and ALOS-2 (2016), were used to
   characterize the tundra land cover of a test site located close to the
   town of Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, Canada. Using available in situ ground data
   collected in 2010 and 2012, we investigate PolSAR scattering
   characteristics of common tundra land cover classes at X-, C- and
   L-Bands. Several decomposition features of quad-, co-, and
   cross-polarized data were compared, the correlation between them was
   investigated, and the class separability offered by their different
   feature spaces was analyzed. Certain PolSAR features at each wavelength
   were sensitive to the land cover and exhibited distinct scattering
   characteristics. Use of shorter wavelength imagery (X and C) was
   beneficial for the characterization of wetland and tundra vegetation,
   while L-Band data highlighted differences of the bare ground classes
   better. The Kennaugh Matrix decomposition applied in this study provided
   a unified framework to store, process, and analyze all data
   consistently, and the matrix offered a favorable feature space for class
   separation. Of all elements of the quad-polarized Kennaugh Matrix, the
   intensity based elements K0, K1, K2, K3 and K4 were found to be most
   valuable for class discrimination. These elements contributed to better
   class separation as indicated by an increase of the separability metrics
   squared Jefferys Matusita Distance and Transformed Divergence. The
   increase in separability was up to 57\% for Radarsat-2 and up to 18\%
   for ALOS-2 data.}},

Title = {{The Kennaugh element framework for multi-scale, multi-polarized,

Abstract = {{As the number of space-borne SAR sensors increases, a rising number of
   different SAR acquisition modes is in use, resulting in a higher
   variation within the image products. This variability in acquisition
   geometry, radiometry, and last but not least polarimetry raises the need
   for a consistent SAR image description incorporating all available
   sensors and acquisition modes. This paper therefore introduces the
   framework of the Kennaugh elements to comparably represent all kinds of
   multi-scale, multi-temporal, multi-polarized, multi-frequency, and
   hence, multi-sensor data in a consistent mathematical framework.
   Furthermore, a novel noise model is introduced that estimates the
   significance and thus the (polarimetric) information content of the
   Kennaugh elements. This facilitates an advanced filtering approach,
   called multi-scale multi-looking, which is shown to improve the
   radiometric accuracy while preserving the geometric resolution of SAR
   images. The proposed methodology is finally demonstrated using sample
   applications that include TerraSAR-X (X-band), Envisat-ASAR, RADARSAT-2
   (C-band) and ALOS-PALSAR (L-band) data as well as the combination of all
   three frequencies. Thus the suitability of the Kennaugh element
   framework for practical use in proved for advanced SAR remote sensing.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a radar target recognition algorithm based on a
   feature set extracted from the target characteristic polarization states
   (CPS) and evaluated at a set of target resonant frequencies in the
   frequency domain. The algorithm involves measuring the proximity between
   training (stored) prototypes and a test prototype. For this task, the
   algorithm implements the nearest neighbour (NN) algorithm at each
   resonance to give a vote, and then the majority resonance vote is used
   to identify the test target prototype. The approach begins by using the
   power optimization procedure of the Kennaugh power matrix at a set of
   resonant frequencies to derive a series of CPS (expressed in normalized
   Stokes vector form) together with their associated receiver power
   levels. Then, certain CPS are selected and weighted by their associated
   power levels to create the feature set. Finally, a Euclidean metric is
   used to determine the minimum k-NN distances between the training
   prototypes and a test prototype, and the target selected by the majority
   of the resonances is the identified target. The paper includes the
   identification performance for two symmetrical targets of similar
   electrical lengths.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of characteristic polarization states (CPSs) is extended to
   an ultrawideband (UWB) context. This is achieved by a sparse
   representation of the target UWB scattering spectrum by a set of
   frequency bands associated with the target natural resonance modes. The
   polarization description involves using the average power within each
   resonant frequency band to derive the Kennaugh power matrix and,
   subsequently, a set of CPSs using the Lagrangian optimization procedure.
   To validate this, preliminary feature sets are formed by extracting
   robust information from each derived CPS and then implementing a
   correlation measure criterion from which the relationships between these
   preliminary feature sets as a function of resonance order are
   established. These relationships are invariant to range and target
   orientation about the radar-target direction and are robust to noise.}},

Abstract = {{In a co- or cross-polarized channel, the polarization states of the
   transmitting and receiving antennas are the same or orthogonal, and the
   corresponding target nulls (i.e., the CO-POL Nulls or X-POL Nulls) are
   defined as the polarization states of the transmitting antenna such that
   the received power equals zero. However, no systematic studies have been
   carried out to solve the problem of the corresponding target nulls if
   the polarization states of the transmitting and receiving antennas are
   independent. In this paper, the target null theory is extended to the
   case of two independent polarization states. For two arbitrary
   independent symmetric scattering matrices, it is proved that there
   exists only one pair of polarization states such that both of the
   received powers equal zero. This polarization states' pair is called the
   co-null of the two targets, which can easily be obtained by solving an
   eigenvalue problem. Based on this concept and algebraic theory, the
   concept of the co-null space is introduced for the symmetric scattering
   matrix case, and many important results are presented, e.g., the
   relations between the co-null and the CO-POL/X-POL Nulls, the properties
   of the co-null space, and the relation between the co-null and target
   decomposition. Finally, the co-null for the asymmetric scattering matrix
   case is studied. The concepts of the mono-co-null space and the
   bi-co-null space are introduced, and the relations between both spaces
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a problem originating in radar polarimetry for which the
   radar target is to be characterized by the properties of its coherent
   polarization state, given complete coherent backscattering matrix data
   sets at one frequency and for one target aspect angle.  First, the Jones
   vector formalism for the coherent monostatic case and Sinclair's
   backscattering matrix {[}S(AB)] for the general polarization basis (AB)
   are introduced.  Using the unitary change of polarization state
   transformation, we present the concept of the characteristic
   polarization states of a scatterer, which was introduced by Kennaugh and
   Huynen.  The generalized unitary transformation matrix formulation under
   the change-of-basis transformation, expressed in terms of the
   generalized polarization ratio rho(AB), is developed for emphasizing the
   unique properties of the interrelation among the existing characteristic
   polarization states.  For the monostatic reciprocal case (S(AB) = S(BA))
   treated here, it is shown that there exist in total five pairs of
   characteristic polarization states:  the orthogonal cross-polarization
   null and the copolarization maximum-state pairs, which are identical and
   share one main circle with the copolarization null and the orthogonal
   cross-polarization maximum-state pairs, the latter being at right angles
   to the cross-polarization null pairs; and a newly identified pair, the
   orthogonal cross-polarization saddle-point extrema that are normal to
   the plane (main circle) spanned by the other four pairs.  With this
   complete and unique mathematical description of Huynen's polarization
   fork concept, it is possible to study the problem of polarimetric radar
   target optimization more rigorously.  Various examples are provided and
   interpreted by comparing the unique result with the results of previous
   incomplete analyses.  In conclusion, the relevance of these canonical
   results to optical polarimetry are highlighted and interpreted.}},
