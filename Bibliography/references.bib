  abstract = {This paper presents the use of a new distribution for fully polarimetric image classification. Several classification strategies are compared in order to assess the importance of a careful statistical modeling of the data and the complementary nature of the information provided by different frequencies. Spatial context, which is relevant in order to obtain good results with noisy data, is described by means of the multiclass Potts model, and an iterated conditional modes classification algorithm that employs pseudolikelihood is proposed. The data are described using multivariate Gaussian laws and fully multilook polarimetric distributions arising from the multiplicative model. L-band, C-band, and both bands are used to assess the influence of dimensionality on the classification. Contextual and pointwise maximum-likelihood classifications are compared using real data. Results show that both context and number of frequencies contribute for better classification products, and that, a careful statistical description of the data leads to improved results.},

	Abstract                 = {The Kennaugh-Huynen scattering matrix con-diagonalization is projected into the Pauli basis to derive a new scattering vector model for the representation of coherent target scattering. This model permits a polarization basis invariant representation of coherent target scattering in terms of five independent target parameters, the magnitude and phase of the symmetric scattering type introduced in this paper, and the maximum polarization parameters (orientation, helicity, and maximum return). The new scattering vector model served for the assessment of the Cloude-Pottier incoherent target decomposition. Whereas the Cloude-Pottier scattering type alpha and entropy H are roll invariant, beta and the so-called target-phase parameters do depend on the target orientation angle for asymmetric scattering. The scattering vector model is then used as the basis for the development of new coherent and incoherent target decompositions in terms of unique and roll-invariant target parameters. It is shown that both the phase and magnitude of the symmetric scattering type should be used for an unambiguous description of symmetric target scattering. Target helicity is required for the assessment of the symmetry-asymmetry nature of target scattering. The symmetric scattering type phase is shown to be very promising for wetland classification in particular, using polarimetric Convair-580 synthetic aperture radar data collected over the Ramsar Mer Bleue wetland site to the east of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada},

Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques that depend on this model are devised, and many of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper, we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained that lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances.},
